<p>This document explains how the Android app "Baby Buddy for Android"
uses your data to provide its services, how it processes your data, and
how you can delete your data from the app.</p>
<h1 id="short-summary">Short summary</h1>
<p>The Baby Buddy for Android app (hereafter: "the app" or "this app")
allows you to interact with a Baby Buddy Website. For this purpose, data
is stored locally on the your Android device. The app does not interact
with any other service, website or device besides your Android device
and the connected <a href="https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy">Baby
Buddy Website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-stored">What is stored?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This app stores the following data locally on your Android
device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login information for logging in to the Baby Buddy Website you
connect the app to</li>
<li>Copies of data from the Baby Buddy Website you connect the app to
(more details in section <a href="#baby-buddy-local-data">Baby Buddy
local data</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The app does not connect with any other service, website or
device. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not communicate with any other service or website other
than the Baby Buddy Website you connect the app to.</li>
<li>The app does not store data on any other devices besides your
Android device and the Baby Buddy Website that you connect the app
to.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-is-your-data-used-for">What is your data used for?</h1>
<p>The app uses your data to provide its features and functions. The
app's purpose is to streamline access to a connected Baby Buddy Website
so that it is easier to use on a handheld Android device. In order to do
so, the app uses your login information to authenticate itself with a
Baby Buddy Website. It then copies some of the data from the website on
your Android device to provide you fast access to information stored on
the Baby Buddy Website.</p>
<p>If you choose to start or stop timers, or log events for children,
data you provide through those actions is sent and stored on the
connected Baby Buddy Website.</p>
<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>Data transfers between the app and the connected Baby Buddy Website
is only secured (encrypted) if the Baby Buddy Website uses Secure HTTP
(<code>https</code>).</p>
<p>You can choose to override a security warning and login to an
unsecured (<code>http</code>) Baby Buddy Website if you like.
Communication between the Android app and the server will then be
<em>unencrypted</em> and <em>insecure</em>. This mode is mainly intended
for local network installations of the Baby Buddy Website which do not
necessarily require full encryption of the communication between app and
website.</p>
<h1 id="baby-buddy-local-data">Baby Buddy local data</h1>
<p>Baby Buddy uses a local file on your Android device to store:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API-Token that associated with the user that you use to login to
the connected Baby Buddy Website.</li>
<li>A subset of data that is stored on the Baby Buddy Website as part of
a local <em>cache</em>. This data includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>All children (names, ids, etc.) registered on the Baby Buddy
Website</li>
<li>The name of the user that is logged in to the Baby Buddy
Website</li>
<li>A subset of all logged events for all children</li>
<li>Tag names, tag colors</li>
<li>The timezone of the Baby Buddy Website</li>
<li>User messages stored as part of logged events for children</li>
<li>The list of timers, start times of the timers, and names of all
timers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="data-retention-and-deletion">Data retention and deletion</h1>
<p>Data which is stored on your Android device can be deleted by you at
any time through the app by:</p>
<ul>
<li>logging out from a connected Baby Buddy Website via the app
menu,</li>
<li>or by deleting the app-data via the Android App-settings
interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data which the app sends to a connected Baby Buddy Website will be
stored on the Baby Buddy Website and cannot be deleted directly through
the app. How data is deleted from the website depends on the privacy
policy and implementation of the Baby Buddy Website. <em>This is not
part of the privacy policy of this Android app</em>.</p>
<h2 id="no-data-collection-by-third-parties">No data collection by third
parties</h2>
<p>Baby Buddy for Android does not use a third-party server or other
service to provide its functions. Instead, you are expected to host your
own instance of the <a
href="https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy">Baby Buddy Website
(<span>https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy</span>)</a> which you
control yourself.</p>
<p>All information entered into the application will only be transmitted
to the connected server. Baby Buddy for Android does not collect and
share your or your device's data with any other party.</p>
