# Logging in

## Login

![](screenshots/help_login_page.png)

There are two options for connecting to your Babybuddy server:
Enter your Babybuddy server URL, username, and password. Then press
login to connect the Babybuddy app to the Babybuddy server. Or you choose the
QR Code option (scroll down for details on that option).

## QR Code login

Alternatively, you can login to your Babybuddy Server using a login QR-code. Login to
your Babybuddy Server from another device. Then navigate
via the user menu (top-right) to the "Add a device" page. This is where you find
the login QR-code. Scan the QR-code with the app on your phone. If
scanned successfully, you should get the option to login to Babybuddy
by pressing the "Login now" button.

## Insecure Login

If you use an http-address instead of an https-address, the application will
show you this warning. Only use this feature for local BabyBuddy servers in a
network that you control!

## Home Assistant Ingress

Babybuddy for Android has partial support for logging in
to a Babybuddy server that is hosted on a Homeassistant Ingress-server. You
will need to use the QR-code login option to login to such a server.

Saving a feeding will trigger a second form, where the feeding type (e.g., solid food) and
method must be entered before the feeding can be stored.

## Other timers

![](screenshots/help_timers_default.png)

In a previous version of Babybuddy for Android, the app listed an arbitrary
number of timers. Now, by default, only timers for the events that can be tracked
by the app are visible. This was changed to achieve compatibility with
Baby Buddy version 2.0.

# Logging Diapers

The history at the bottom of the screen shows the most recent activities of
the selected child. You can edit entries by pressing the entry in the history for three
seconds. This will open the corresponding page in the BabyBuddy app.
